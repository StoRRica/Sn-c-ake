# Sn(c)ake
Teh game 

This is our implamantation of game we call Sn(c)ake, as the name suggest it is a kind of snake based game with one difference.
You don't hit any key to tell snake which way to go, but you need to put portals on the board. 
There are two kinds of portal in going and outgoing. So basically you telport snake all over the board (except obstacles) and choose
which way the snake will go by outgoing portals. 

Whole project is done in Unity.
